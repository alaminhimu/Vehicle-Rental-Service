# Vehicle-Rental-Service
This is a simple C++ console application for a Vehicle Rental System.

It uses Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) with a base `Vehicle` class and three specific child classes: `Bus`, `Ambulance`, and `Bicycle`.
The program presents a main menu with two options:
1.  **Rent Vehicle:** Lets the user choose one of the three vehicle types. It then displays the details of the rented vehicle (model, color, and price).
2.  **Pickup and drop-off locations:** Displays a static list of two locations in Dhaka.

The program loops continuously using a `goto` statement to return to the main menu after each action.
